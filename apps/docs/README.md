## Building and previewing your site locally

Assuming [Jekyll] and [Bundler] are installed on your computer:

1.  Change your working directory to the root directory of your site.

2.  Run `bundle install`.

3.  Run `bundle exec jekyll serve` to build your site and preview it at `localhost:4000`.

    The built site is stored in the directory `_site`.

## Customization

The Docs site is built using the Just The Docs Jekyll theme on Github Pages (dev branch). [Check the documentations](https://just-the-docs.github.io/just-the-docs/) to learn more about how to use this theme.
