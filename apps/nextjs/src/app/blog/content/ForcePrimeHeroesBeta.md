> Following the launch of its ‘always on’ beta, we proudly welcome *Force Prime Heroes* to [Realms.World](https://realms.world/games/force-prime-heroes)

With 10,000 games played in pre-alpha, it's evident that Force Prime Heroes captures the magic of an enjoyable strategy game. Inspired by the legendary *Heroes of Might and Magic* series, players are cast onto a monster-filled map with one ultimate goal: to figure out how to raid and kill the Bone Dragon.

### Feel the Force, 24/7

Force Prime Heroes has launched its open beta. Launch the fully onchain game from their [website](http://forceprime.io) or [Realms.World](https://realms.world/games/force-prime-heroes). The first monthly season recently opened, and as you play you accrue points and compete for a share of this month’s 1,000 STRK prize pot. There are weekly tournaments and blitz tournaments - [follow Force Prime on X for ongoing updates.](https://x.com/ForcePrime_io/status/1787866521986801795)

The Force Prime Heroes beta is a single-player game with a global leaderboard. Players strategically traverse the game map, forge formidable armies, vanquish hordes of monsters, and uncover the most effective path to confront the final boss.


With multiple maps (10 this month!) and a competitive player-base, Force Prime Heroes will bring out your competitive side. The developers at Force Prime have an ambitious roadmap for the game so the replay factor will keep bringing you back to the fight.  
  

  

### Legendary beginnings

  

Force Prime Heroes is the debut title from Force Prime, a web3 studio helmed by veterans of traditional gaming. Recognising onchain gaming as an open space for creating new kinds of player experience, the team has fully embraced the concept, leveraging the zkVM and Dojo stack.

  

Realms.World is the hub of the Realms onchain gaming ecosystem. Here you will find a dozen games in development, many with their sights set on mainnet on L2 and/or L3 in the coming months. Games in the Realms ecosystem will lean into composability of assets from across game worlds - like Blobert and the Loot Survivor beasts - and integration of the Realms currency, $Lords.

  
  

### Game worlds are the fabric of the Realms

  

Force Prime Heroes is a vibrant game world complete with its own lore, characters, physics, and rules. There are several studio’s game worlds evolving inside the Realms - including Banners, Eternum, Grugs Lair, Loot Survivor, Mississippi, Paved, Underware and zKorp (see them all [here](https://realms.world/studios)).

  

Force Prime Heroes, like the other worlds, maintains its own distinct style and setting, but is open to expansion and modification by players and developers. As the Realms ecosystem unfolds, players will hop between game worlds enjoying both the creator's original vision and the mash-ups and modifications that gamers and developers will bring.
